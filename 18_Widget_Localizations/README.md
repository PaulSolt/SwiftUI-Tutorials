# Localizations for iOS and iOS Widgets - SwiftUI

This demo project shows how to adapt a project for localizations.

You will learn how to use String(localized:) and the new String Catalog.

I'll show you how to test your localizations for iOS using [RocketSim](https://www.rocketsim.app/) and for iOS Widget Previews.
