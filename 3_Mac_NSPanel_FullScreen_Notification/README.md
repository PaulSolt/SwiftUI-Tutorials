# How to Make a Full Screen Notification on macOS with NSPanel
2024-06-06

Learn how you can create a Full Screen Notification on macOS using a NSPanel that floats above all other Full Screen apps and windows. You can use this technique to take over the entire screen or to just show a little toast animation in a corner.

I use both AppKit (Cocoa) and SwiftUI to demo the notification message over the entire screen contents. Feel free to make adjustments to fit your needs.
